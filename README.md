# Ocean-Engineering-Project
Class final assignment

This is an assignment in my ocean engineering class where we were able to explore and find a project 
we wanted to work on. It entailed finding data on the OOI (or a similiar site with ocean data) and use
it to solve a scientific question that we come up with.

A question I am interested in is:

Are there any major differences between Argentine Basin, South Pacific Ocean, and North Pacific 
Ocean? Also, have there been any major changes at the bottom of the ocean at these points over time?

To solve this question, I went to the OOI (Ocean Observatories Initiative) and found data from 
profile moorings at each of these points. Here are three links to each of the points where I accessed
the data:

Global Southern:

Global Station Papa:

Analysis:

I requested data from these sites, and looking at the graphs through there sites, determined the best 
times to take the most accurate data. On their graphs, they have annotations that say when there may
have been an error in deployment or something went wrong. So I tried to work around that data and pick
the earliest and latest data points I could get for each station. With the data, I created code that would
go through them and graph different parts of the data versus time, and then compare the old and new graphs 
to see how they match up. Then I compared the graphs to the other stations to see if there were any 
consistencies.
